          In 1966, Lambton College was the second college in the Ontario college system to officially open. At this time 45 students were enrolled in five programs at the college. The main campus' cornerstone was dedicated on June 4, 1970. <br><br>
          The cornerstone is a time capsule containing coins, bills, stamps, the college calendar for 1970â€“71, a copy of the school's charter, the school seal, a copy of the land deed for the college among other items. <br><br>
          The first president of Lambton College was Wolfgang Franke. He started full-time duties in January 1967 and his starting salary was $18,000. The first faculty tour of the original site was delayed because the building housing the classrooms was locked and no one had the key. Faculty member Ron Lawrence discovered (much to his dismay) that his house key fit the lock. In 1975 a sculpture commissioned by the school, Homage, was constructed by artist Haydn Davies. The college destroyed the sculpture in 2005. The destruction of the sculpture has been controversial and was the subject of a lawsuit settled in 2010.
